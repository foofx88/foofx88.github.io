  <p> Sally(サリー Sarī)is a female chick who is the fifth main member of LINE friends. She is Brown's tag-along buddy who also see's her as the little sister he never had. </p>
  <p>Although she is naive, Sally can be quite clever sometimes. Furthermore, she is also a bit cunning because of the lack of attention from her friends, such as sticking close to brown bear because she see's him as the big brother she never. </p>
